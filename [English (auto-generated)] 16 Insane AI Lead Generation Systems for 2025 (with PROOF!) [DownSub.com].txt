I surveyed over
110,000 AI agency owners asking them to
reveal their most powerful AI lead
generation systems with their proof and
receipts and what came back was insane
we had a small travel agency making an
extra 80,000 in just one month a legal
influencer who's got more leads in the
past 3 months than they've got in the
entire past 3 years and so so much more
and these aren't just hypotheticals
they're actual real systems that are
built into businesses right now and are
absolutely rushing it so today I'm going
to be revealing the 16 most valuable AI
lead generation systems on the planet
right now so whether you're a business
owner who wants to get more leads for
your business or you're an entrepreneur
who's looking to sell these kinds of AI
systems to businesses I'm about to show
you exactly what is working in 2025 for
each of these 16 AI systems you'll see
real Revenue numbers from the people who
are selling them payment screenshots to
prove that they're actually selling them
which Industries these systems are being
sold and dominating in and if you stick
around to the end I'll be sharing how to
build each system for yourself let's get
into it but quickly if you are new to
the channel and don't know who I am my
name is Liam Motley and I've been
building and selling AI Solutions like
the ones we're going to be covering in
this video for the past 2 years through
my agency Morningside AI I'm also the
founder and owner of the largest AI
business community on the entire School
platform and probably the entire world
by now um which is my AI automation
agency Hub this community is where I've
had access to these 110,000 AI agency
owners that have been used to put
together this particular video if you
are a business business owner who's
interested in what AI could do for your
business or you're an aspiring
entrepreneur wanting to start an AI
business all of my links are in the
description
below first up we have my friend Ricardo
bellorini and his agency who built an AI
WhatsApp engagement system that helped
this travel agency to generate an
additional 80,000 in a single month what
makes this solution particularly
valuable is that it's using AI to
squeeze more value out of leads that
these businesses already have so it's
not technically lead generation but it's
still generating more business through
the existing leads that they have so
more so reactivation but this in many
ways is better than lead generation
because instead of spending more money
on ads or trying to generate New Leads
it's reactivating their existing
database that's just sitting around
clicking dust so here's basically how
the system works it's taking the dead
leads from the travel agency's database
it's sending personalized WhatsApp
messages with targeted travel offers
then when they receive responses an AI
agent is jumping in on WhatsApp and
nurturing the responses asking questions
and suggesting potential destinations
and finally this agent is going to be
booking appointments for those qualified
leads this whole process is running
around 3 to five times per month
according to Ricardo which is
consistently bringing dead leads back to
life and converting them into new
bookings for this travel agency Ricardo
is selling this for € 2,600 up front and
€150 to €200 monthly and you can see
from the screenshots just up here what I
love about the solution and you're going
to see this repeated a few times through
the other ones we're going to cover is
that it's solving a universal problem
which is dead leads in a database it's
using channels that people already
actually respond to which is WhatsApp
it's requiring zero ad spend to generate
new business and it's generating an
immediate Roi for the businesses that he
works with if you want to get in touch
with Ricardo or learn more about his
agency or watch his YouTube videos his
details will be in the description
below next we have Fahad shedi who built
an AI chatbot system for two massive
legal influencers one with 25 million
followers and the other with 20 million
plus and the problem they were facing is
a classic for these kinds of high trffic
influencer businesses with so much
attention on them their old lead capture
system was just a lengthy contact form
that was basically killing their
conversion rates and losing ton of
opportunities plus they were getting
flooded with DMS on Instagram and
messenger that they couldn't possibly
answer in time so with these problems in
mind here's what fad solution does
firstly they deploy AI agents across the
influencers website Instagram and
messenger and through these channels
they give empathetic and immediate
responses to people who are seeking
legal help and they're kind of
conversating back and forth and this
essentially gives personalized
suggestions based on the situation and
then transitions into seamlessly
capturing the lead information from that
person and putting it into the CRM so
it's basically making these people who
are reaching out and saying hey I have
this problem can you help with me and
it's being really compassionate and
empathetic and saying all hey man I
totally understand yes totally this is
what you should be doing this this this
and then naturally going for the lead
capture once a bit of value has been
given by the DMS and the results from
this have been pretty bloody incredible
they are getting three times more leads
in the last 3 months than they did in
the previous 3 years and more
importantly they can actually manage
this kind of volume thanks to the
automation system that fad has built so
it's going to be able to scale with them
as they increase their content output so
fad is selling these for $25 $500 up
front for two Bots plus $500 per month
for the first and $350 for the second
one one of his retainers has actually
going to $1,200 per month just to manage
both of these systems and here's the
screenshots up here for proof now what
makes this solution so powerful is that
it's converting the traffic 24/7 across
multiple different channels you've got
messenger Instagram and their website so
this is handling massive volume without
breaking a sweat essentially without
having massive teams of sets and people
on the DMS replying and interestingly
using the AI is actually improving the
overall user experience versus going to
the the form and of course A major
advantage of this kind of system is that
it scales perfectly with their growing
social presence so if you want to see
this in action or get in touch with fad
you can get in touch with them in the
description
below next up is my good friend s yasar
who's built an AI follow-up system for
Real Estate Investors who are doing
massive amounts of direct mail and also
cold calling so here's quickly how it
works when someone calls back about a
mailer that they receive in the L box
the AI system answers that call
immediately does the intake and updates
the CRM so basically collects your
information and anything that need to
related to the mailer that they received
and it also keeps in touch with these
people over months through either phone
SMS or email in order to find off-market
properties that the Realtors can sell
and what makes it special is that
Simon's actually built an entire private
SAS platform for his clients that they
can control themselves so they can start
stop or take over from the AI whenever
they want so Salon has been selling this
for $10,000 up front plus a $1,500
monthly retainer and it's so effective
that epic real estate one of the biggest
real estate YouTube channels is going to
be featuring his platform on their
Channel soon and here's a screen shots
for proof if you want to see more
details about the platform and get in
touch with salmon you can check out his
links in the
description next we have harha tamborini
who's built something called digid
Doppel an AI powered content creation
system primarily focused on Instagram
lead generation through AI generated
content so here's a a quick breakdown of
how it works they basically create an AI
clone for you that replicates your voice
video appearance and communication style
so you can replicate me doing these
videos like this this clone then
automatically generates high quality
videos for social media content handling
everything from script writing and
editing to even posting as well so it's
full automation of short form content
for social media they're using a pretty
extensive text stack on this they have
haen 11 labs and Tavis for the content
generation itself then they're using
mini chat for lead generation so when
you post the short form content they say
hey reply to me this then they mini
check and kick in and message them
privately and capture their lead
information so that's the lead
generation aspect of it they're also
using zapia for CRM integration and
notion for General content management
what makes this valuable is the kind of
scale you can get out of it it's going
to save entrepreneurs 10 hours or more
on just the recording side of things and
it's ensuring that they're consistently
posting and on the platforms that they
want to and it could even pump out 10
videos per day without requiring any
additional time investment from the
client so it's pretty high leverage
system once you've got it working and
really dialed into the kinds of scripts
and the Avatar that you're happy with
hash's highest playing client with this
offer is being $4,500 per month with
most clients paying around the $3,000
per month mark But the current price
point that he's selling it at is $4,000
per month so here's the screenshot on
there if you want to see so if you want
to see digid dopple in action or learn
more about how it's helping other
entrepreneurs to build their personal
Brands and generate leads on Instagram

details in the
description next up is Ben web who's
built an AI system that's solving a
critical problem for local service
businesses like clinics Spar and beauty
salons which is consistently attracting
and booking high quality clients so
here's how the system works first
they're running targeted meta ads to
attract potential clients to their
landing page or to their lead form and
then when they submit that form their AI
chat or voice assistance will
immediately get in touch with them and
qualify them in real time and answer all
their questions about the product or
about the services the system then
integrates with their popular scheduling
platforms like timely and fresher for
these local service businesses in order
to handle the bookings as well followed
by automated appointment reminders and
follow-ups in order to maximize your
attendance so this is really a
comprehensive local business lead
generation system that relies on social
media marketing and in this case meta
ads to bring the attention to the
landing pages once they're submitting
that they're immediately following up
after they've submitted and getting
speed to lead which is really a theme
you're going to see across a lot of
these solutions that I'm covering today
the speed to lead concept of saying how
quickly can we get the AI to follow up
either by voice WhatsApp or SMS or email
how quickly can we get back to them and
touch base with them and increase the
chance that they're going to convert
down the line so what makes us valuable
is that it's coste effective of course
so it's replacing these full-time
receptionist or vas that would have to
call up and and have a chat to the
people and answer their questions it's
going to be working 24/7 so it's never
missing any opportunities that come in
through those lead forms and it's going
to be handling everything from lead cap
to bookings and also follow-ups as well
and compared to a human operated version
of the system that would likely have a
delay of a few hours before they got
back to the leads they're going to be
seeing much higher conversion rates and
lower drop off rates from the money that
they spend on paid ads to people who end
up booking so that's just a massive win
for the business and no matter which way
you slice it Ben's been selling this for
6,300 AUD or Aussie dollars for a
3-month engagement with no setup free so
just that 3mon for 6,300 and he says
that businesses are loving it because
they can handle more clients without
needing additional stuff if you want to
learn more about B system or get in
touch with them his details will be in
the description
below next is p zoha who's built an AI
system that helps real estate brokerage
quickly identify which landlords from
their database are actually interested
in selling so here's how it works they
connect a vapy voice agent to their
custom platform which calls through the
brokerage's landlord database and has
natural conversation to verify the
landlord's current market interest like
IU interested in selling where are you
at with your properties right now are
you looking to buy Etc everything gets
tracked in a simple dashboard showing
interested leads cost per call call
duration and of course the full call
transcripts as well the best part about
it is that you can use their built-in
CRM you can connect it to your existing
one or you can even work directly with
Google Sheets if you so choose we are
seeing more and more of these kinds of
solutions pop up because it's really
using AI at its best which is hey this
is completely not time effective or cost
effective for us to go and call up all
these people in our database or to to go
and call all these people generally and
ask them if they're interested in
selling we just don't have the people or
we don't have the time or money for that
but if you set up a system like this you
can do that and that is such a
significant competitive advantage and
this is something we're seeing
replicated across multiple Industries
not just and you'll see in this video
not just in the real estate industry and
of course if you want to see the system
in action pavz has a video demo showing
exactly how the system works which you
can check out through his contact links
in the
description next up we have Kevin Hogan
who's built an outbound AI voice agent
that engages Facebook leads instantly
and it's already being used by 100 plus
person HVAC company and a patent law
firm if you've been listening closely
you'll realize that this is similar to
one with has covered which is attacking
this post lead capture followup and
decreasing that speed to lead and this
is a similar one just used in a
different industry where's the problem
that it solves right many businesses who
have a good client acquisition system
they get a flood of leads but they
ultimately can't engage with them fast
enough leading to missed opportunities
and lost Revenue Kev system fixes this
by having an AI voice agent that calls
leads within seconds of them opting in
on their lead form or through their
Facebook ad and this outbound voice
agent then qualifies them based on a
predefined criteria takes custom actions
like sending follow-up emails to them or
scheduling callbacks and then it
captures all the relevant information
into the business's CRM so Kevin's been
selling this for up to $2,000 up front
with a $500 monthly retainer and this
includes data analytics dashboards so
businesses can keep refining the agent's
performance over time so I'll pop up the
screenshots here of course if you want
to get in touch with Kevin or learn more
about his instant lead engagement system
his details are going to be in the
description like everyone
else's next we have Ali Muhammad who's
buil an AI voice call caller for
insurance broker pies using vapy
make.com and air table what makes the
system special is the conversational
approach which instead of trying to sell
anything up front with this Ai call
calling the AI simply asks when was the
last time you reviewed your insurance so
through this indirect kind of non- pushy
approach it gets such good results and
Ali spent so much time on fine-tuning
the Australian accent I don't give a rip
whose money it is and and the vapy agent
as a whole that out of hundreds maybe
even thousands of calls he says only one
person has ever spotted that it was AI
so this system works by sending outbound
calls with his voice agent and if
someone is interested in reviewing their
insurance it marks them as a warm lead
and sends them an SMS saying a senior
advisor will be in touch if they miss
this call it tries again in case they
run do not disturb and there's even a
separate inbound AI agent to handle the
callbacks so this whole thing is built
with four different make.com scenarios
that process the post call analysis
letting you see warm and unqualified
leads at a glance Ali has been selling
this complete system for $
4,660 up front and he says it's
converting like crazy because of how
natural and non salesy this approach is
by asking them a question instead of
saying hey you interested in buying this
this this it ask them a question says
hey just check in when was the last time
you reviewed your insurance which is a
much more natural way and a really
interesting take on how to use outbound
cold calling agents to generate new
business rather than coming off super
super saly if you want to see Ali's
incredibly detailed system in action you
can check out his links in the
description
below next we have Mahmud ganam who's
built a LinkedIn automation system that
makes it easier for businesses to find
and connect with potential client on
LinkedIn so here's how it work works the
system automatically finds ideal leads
it checks their profiles it sends
personalized messages on LinkedIn or
email but what makes this valuable is
that it also scores leads based on their
interest level and suggests the best
time to follow up so this is basically a
comprehensive LinkedIn lead generation
system that uses Ai and personalization
to on autopilot generate new leads for
your business so Mahmud said that he's
using a combination of aable apollo.io
and make.com to create this complete
lead generation system for sales teams
who want to grow their Network and bmore
meetings Ma's been selling this for
$1,000 up front plus $300 per month
retainer and he even sent through a
video demo showing exactly how this
works he said to not share it publicly
on here but if you want to get in touch
with him and check out this link in
automation system and action his details
will be in the description below and he
may be able to show you that
demo next we have Louie I'm going to
butcher this but Edward
Le who's built what they call the
Trinity system which is a complete lead
management solution for in this case
French infopreneurs coaches and course
creators so it's for the French Market
specifically so here's how the system
works when leads come in from ads or
organic traffic the system immediately
engages them through WhatsApp and you
might start to see these kind of
patterns occurring and and forming
across all these different ones we're
talking about right so immediately
engages them with WhatsApp and then the
system use things like voice flow voice
glow and nadn in order to automatically
qualify the prospects and book
appointments with the qualified ones so
as soon as they come in off Those ads or
the inbound lead comes they are ready to
reach out qualify and set the
appointment with qualified ones so what
makes us valuable is of course that
instant followup and the analytics they
have on the back end so the system
provides realtime data on the lead
quality conversion rates and Roi helping
these infopreneurs as I believe they're
called to optimize their entire sales
funnel so they are selling the system
for €750 as the setup fee but with a
smart twist the first month is a free
trial in order to optimize the system
and get them results then for month two
it's €500 monthly with unlimited
conversations included if you want to
learn more about this TurnKey solution
for course creators and coaches in the
French Market Lou Edis details are in
the description
below next we have Noah mcnamar who's
built something really clever that's
similar to Kevin's instant lead
engagement system that we've seen
earlier but instead of voice calls going
out this one uses highly personalized
emails as that instant followup after
they've received a new lead so here's
how the system works when someone fills
out a contact form instead of just
getting some generic response like most
businesses in the email the system
scrapes the website URL that they
provided in the contact form and uses
Claude to analyze it then just 2 to 3
minutes later the who submitted it will
get a quick email saying we'll respond
in 225 seconds followed by an incredibly
personalized response that shows you've
actually done your homework so it's like
hey here's the automated one hey we'll
get back to you in a second and then
immediately they send a hyper
personalized email that sounds like it's
coming from a sales rep and saying hey
look love what you're doing blah you've
caught me while I'm out at the moment
how does this time work or would you be
available tomorrow XYZ so it feels very
real and it feels like someone's
actually reaching out immediately to try
help them just like Ben's local service
system that we saw earlier this one also
hand handles the booking process and
it's automatically scheduling meetings
when they respond with their preferred
time which is a massive time saer for
the business Noah is selling this for
$3,757 up front and it's increasing the
appointment show up rates by
127% why because when B2B teams
typically take 42 hours to respond to
leads the system does it in just minutes
with genuine personalization so that's
why they're seeing these massively
increased show rates of the leads that
are coming in through their forms if
you're a business owner who's interested
in this kind of system you can get in
contact with Noah in the description
below
next we have Thomas Reed from epicus AI
who's built something called Sparky and
it's similar to no system that we just
saw it's all about deep personalization
for customers but it's taking a slightly
different approach so here's how it
works instead of waiting for contact
form submissions on a website they're
putting an AI lead magnet called Sparky
in their client's websites and this is
essentially a lead generation chat bot
which I've been talking about and
sharing tutorials on on this channel for
so long now which works by engaging
prospects as they land on a site and
trying to instantly provide value like a
website analysis for their or a
competitive breakdown for them using
custom tools that you create to take in
inputs from the customer and say hey
look we can help you out with this here
just provide these details and then you
go and send them back a report or you
send it to the email vice versa and
while it's asking these questions and
providing value it's asking
qualification questions and conducting
deep research on the lead in the
background to make sure that they're
qualified what's clever is how it does
this kind of qualification Sparky is
comparing the lead's answers and
research data that it found online
against what a 10 out of 10 perfect
client looks like so based on this
quality score for it's going to write
out a personalized follow-up scripts and
automatically reaches out to the
prospect until they book a meeting so
this system is all about providing Value
First and making the leads feel obliged
to hear you out rather than pushing for
an immediate sale through this website
chatbot that they've set up so at the
moment Thomas is selling this for £455
per month to digital agencies and it
includes an AI chat bot for 24/7
engagement automated follow-ups across
multiple different channels deep lead
research and Lead scoring and weekly
testing and optimization screenshot
should be up here if you want to check
them out and if of course you want to
learn more about how Thomas has built
this Valley first lead generation system
and what it can do for your business his
details will be in the
description next we have Daniel Padia
who's built an AI system that generates
leads through personalized video
Outreach on LinkedIn and Instagram using
an AI clone of the CEO of the company to
make the connections feel real and
authentic so here's how this works
within just 30 minutes of recording time
from the CEO they will create a digital
twin using different AI tools basically
create a digital Avatar as we talked
about with harsh as one before with this
digital clone or Avatar they're then
able to send highly personalized video
messages to potential leads on LinkedIn
and Instagram basically pass a script to
this Avatar then it will produce a video
of it talking and saying all of the
things you wanted it to say the system
is designed to handle the entire
sequence from writing scripts to
managing objections all through AI
generated videos that look and sound
just like the CEO when they are sending
out these personalized Loom style
Outreach videos Daniel says that they're
seeing a minimum of 5% conversion rate
on booked appointments now I'm not sure
if he means 5% conversion rate on
bookings which would be quite low maybe
he's meaning out of all of the Outreach
messages that they send they are seeing
a 5% booking rate which would probably
sound a lot better uh but I'm not sure
5% conversion rate on bookings I'm not
entirely sure what their booking rate is
on for the system Daniel is charging
$250 per lead usually 250 to 300 leads
per month he Ser plus a $1,000 setup fee
and the package includes the AI tools
the script writing and a dashboard to
track leads and the kpis so the
screenshots are up here you may be
wondering what makes this different from
harshest Digi Doppel system we saw
earlier that this is purely focused on
Direct Outreach and appointment setting
rather than through using AI avatars for
Content creation and brand building so
as you can see learning just one teex
stack or one type of AI technology in
this case AI avatars allows you to build
multiple different offers or in this
case businesses off of it so a lot of
potential for these AI avatars and
they're only getting better and better
and of course if you want to see
examples of these AI generated personal
Outreach videos you can get in touch
with Daniel using the links in the
description next we have Jack Rossy
who's built an AI system that solves the
speed lead problem again seeing a lot of
these but this time it's for property
developers by instantly calling and
qualifying leads that they get from
social media ads so again similar setup
you guys need to look for patterns in
this this is obviously working across
multiple different Industries like if
you're a business owner might be worth
looking into this or if you're a
aspiring AI automation agency owner
might be worth looking into this as well
so again here's how these systems work
in this case a property developer in
Australia was getting 35 leads per week
or 170 per month from social media ads
but the sales team was taking 24 hour on
average to respond but now with the
system in place the moment someone fills
out a form the AI voice agent calls them
instantly runs through their
qualification questions sends a booking
link Via SMS if they qualify and
automatically updates their CRM with all
the data from the call so what makes
this valuable is that it's capitalizing
on that crucial 5minute window of
opportunity which is based on an MIT
study that he provided plus it's
available 24/7 it's even on holidays
it's weeding out the tie tickers before
they even reach the sales team so you're
keeping their motivation high from not
having to deal with a bunch of people on
not qualified and by getting the
qualification out of the way on this
call the sales team can focus purely on
the closing and of course they're
reducing their cost per lead because
they have Fast Response times and
they're seeing less drop off from their
ad span so Jack's been selling the
system for $4,000 up front here's a
screenshot and it's helping both the
property developer by the lower cost per
lead and the higher margins and also the
sales team by getting more qualified
appointments and more commissions for
them as well if you want to learn more
about the speed to lead system Jack
details are in the description
below next we have toas gak who's built
an AI system that generates leads
through Mass personalized email Outreach
capable of sending up to
2,250 highly personalized emails per day
now if that's not going to bring in some
leads for you I don't know what will so
here's how this particular system works
they are combining octave HQ for the ICP
refinement they're using clay for data
enrichment and instantly for sing out
the emails using the open AI API they
ensure that the first sentence of every
email gets genuinely personalized based
on the prospect's data and they even
clean up the company names by removing
things like caps lock or LLC at the end
of names to make the messages fit feel a
whole lot more authentic as well what
makes this valuable is the scale
combined with the personalization and
most of these mass email systems feel
very generic but by using AI to write
custom intros for each Prospect they're
ultimately going to get much better
response rate now this sort of stuff is
nothing new but here's just another
example that I had to put in this video
because in terms of lead generation cold
email is a proven method but this is a
new AI split on it to add in that
personalization layer and I have touched
on this in my other videos of six AI
marketing offers which I'll put up here
wherever it is but I've touched on that
a lot before as well so Tas is selling
this for between $1,500 and $6,000 up
front and they'll even help with the
campaign strategy for the first 3 months
in order to ensure success for the
clients so if you want to learn how you
can get 2,250 personalized emails
blasting out to your icps to generate
leads for your business you can get
touch with toas in the description
below and finally we have Diego signs
who's been a longtime member of my
accelerator it's awesome to be featuring
him in this video he I think he was 17
when he joined he's 18 now but Diego has
built an AI system that generates leads
for marketing agencies by automatically
calling through large contact lists and
booking appointments with the interested
prospects when they respond so here's
how it works the system is basically
taking a list of a th000 plus leads from
the marketing agency it makes
personalized calls throughout the day at
set intervals it's using make.com and
Google Sheets and it tracks which leads
haven't been contacted yet when it calls
it uses the lead's name location and
Company details to make the conversation
feel much more personalized and what's
smart about the system is how it handles
different outcomes firstly if the leader
is interested they get a SMS with the
calendar link to book in missed calls
get a voicemail left and also marked for
a followup in the Google sheet and
uninterested leads are removed from the
list and of course all conversations are
transcribed for later review by the team
my man Diego has been selling this
complete system for just
€650 as a one-time payment making it one
of the most accessible and lowcost lead
generation systems that we've seen in
this video today so if you want to get
this kind of calling system built into
your business you can get in touch with
Diego using his links in the description
below so that's it 16 AI lead generation
systems that are on The Cutting Edge of
the space right now and are selling
successfully in this community and
already driving real value for real
businesses out there that's really the
focus of these videos I I get pissed off
with the two I know there's so much hype
and fluff and crap in this AI space
right now I try to get the best source
from people in our community who are
willing to share it and make this videos
like this and use my platform to shine a
