## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Fixed Widths
Some extracted styles have fixed pixel widths (e.g., `width: 2545.333252px`) which were measured on the original site. These may need:
- Responsive adjustments for smaller screens
- Percentage-based widths instead of fixed pixels
- Media queries for mobile/tablet

### ⚠️ Missing States
Extracted styles are **static** - they don't include:
- `:hover` states
- `:focus` states
- `:active` states
- Transitions/animations

You may need to add these for better UX.

### ⚠️ Dashboard
**Note:** Dashboard page doesn't have a separate extraction file. Dashboard styles may be:
- Shared with other pages
- In the Layout component
- Need to be extracted separately

2. **Add hover/focus states** - Improve interactivity
3. **Merge with existing styles** - If any custom styles were needed
4. **Extract Dashboard styles** - If Dashboard needs separate extraction
5. **Test on multiple browsers** - Ensure cross-browser compatibility
