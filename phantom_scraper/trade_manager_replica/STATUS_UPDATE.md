## If Still Having Issues:

The console shows everything is working! If you're still seeing visual or functional problems:

1. **Hard refresh:** `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Check browser console** for any NEW errors
4. **Describe what specifically looks wrong:**
   - Styling issues? (colors, fonts, layout)
   - Functionality issues? (buttons not working, forms not submitting)
   - Navigation issues? (can't navigate to pages)

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Refresh the page** - All fixes are in place
2. **Test functionality:**
   - Navigate between pages
   - Try creating a strategy
   - Try adding an account
   - Check if all buttons work

**Everything should be working perfectly now!** 🎉

If you see any other issues, let me know what specifically isn't working.
