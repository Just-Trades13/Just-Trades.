MODULE 1 BODY - FIXED (No Token Limit Error)

Use this to avoid OpenAI token limit:

{
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 5
}

→ Gets 5 leads per run (manageable for OpenAI)
→ No token limit errors
→ Run multiple times with different pages for more leads

To get more leads:
- Run 1: page 1 → 5 leads
- Run 2: page 2 → 5 leads  
- Run 3: page 3 → 5 leads
- etc.

10 runs = 50 leads ✅
