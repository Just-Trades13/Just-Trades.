hey my name is Nick I scaled my
automation agency to 72k a month with 1
VA and the entire way that I was able to
do this was selling the right systems as
an automation agency there are a ton of
systems that you theoretically can sell
but not a lot that I think you
realistically should sell if you want to
make multiples in your time so the
purpose of this video is to show you
five more automations that you guys
could sell today for between $1,500 to
$10,000 I built all these systems using
a mixture of N and make.com and we going
to be including all the templates Below
in the description so feel free to
repurpose them use them for whatever the
hell you want if that sounds good to you
let's get into
it all right so I'm going to be showing
you these systems in a second I've built
them out in n8n and then I've also build
a bunch out in make.com you guys are
going to get to see both but just before
I show you guys the actual systems I
just want to talk a little bit about
what makes a highy automation a high
automation to begin with and the reason
why we need to cover this if you think
about it is because our industry moves
really quickly AI is a very
intrinsically fast-moving sort of
technology so is a lot of these
automation platforms that we're using
and while learning specific systems is
great you know if you think about it the
systems that I and you are going to be
selling today are not necessarily going
to be the same ones we're going to be
selling a year from now because business
needs are going to change they're going
to be new software platforms that solve
these problems um and so what's
important is not necessarily learning
the exact systems uh but the underlying
principles that enable you to choose
good systems to sell in the future so
briefly uh there are three components to
a great High Roi automation the first is
it needs to be something that produces a
clear clear deliverable clear
deliverable in this case is a document
it's an email it's a CRM it's a line
item I said email twice there sui uh Etc
essentially this is something that like
the customer can actually touch and feel
or can get us close to it while
interacting with a computer the reason
why and I'm going to cover this in a lot
more detail in a second is just because
you know automations are systems right
and that might mean something to you and
I what the hell does that mean to like
an average small to midsized business
owner right they're hiring us because
they're not very technical most of the
time the second is that your system
needs to solve hot button paino and this
is something that generally just impacts
revenue or profit and the third is you
just need a way to template the vast
majority of your system and this is
typically done through no code platforms
like nadn make.com zappier um or you
know copying and pasting scripts
whatever the hell you want to do so
let's chat about this first one uh
producing a clear deliverable
essentially in order for your system to
be good and in order for you to be able
to scale it and sell and make any sort
of meaningful amount of money with it it
needs to produce something tangible for
the client tangible in this case means
you know a document means an email it
means a CRM system some sort of asset uh
some sort of line item Okay the reason
why is because systems are by Nature
immaterial they are processes and
software infrastructure like to a lay
person is very difficult to visualize
your goal is to turn this from some
weird scary intimidating Black Box sort
of idea into something your client can
actually imagine touching or feeling
something they could see for themselves
these are going to produce immediate
results this is also going to mean that
they are much easier to quantify than
it's going to allow you to claim
straight forward wins which are going to
snowball you into being able to do
things like at higher ticket retainers
and so on and so forth um the reason why
I'm harping on this guys is because
there are tons of systems out there that
you guys will see scrolling through
YouTube while doing your binge system
stuff and they're great and all but very
few of them are systems that if you were
able to put it in front of a client and
ask them hey do you want this for this
much money very few of those systems
would get a resounding yes and the
reason why is because they're sort of
built for it's almost like they're built
for like a YouTube audience they're
built for like the developer audience
they're not NE necessarily built for a
small to midsize business customers that
you know are looking to to have some
practical need fulfilled so these points
that I'm making here like if you if you
really want to make money in this
industry these are things that you just
sort of you sort of have to get um
here's some quick examples the first
might be like a PDF generator okay so if
you build a PDF generator system for the
customer it needs to produce something
physically that the customer can touch
so white paper quote estimate maybe the
customer fills out a form every single
time a form is filled out they get
something they receive an email says
congratulations you just you know
generated some new PDF right another one
may be a comprehensive CRM that your
client can navigate through a beautiful
Aesthetics uh you know colors and and
buttons and stuff like that this isn't
just something that the customer is
going to use okay it's something that
every single person on their team is
going to use every day week and month
thereafter you get to claim the win
every time they're staring at that thing
which to be honest is going to be the
vast majority of their workday the last
might be like a cold email system that
generates an email every time it's
responded to right every time that you
get a a positive response or something
or maybe every time a response comes in
you filter it through AI you say is this
a good response is the customer going to
like this okay sweet if so voila I'm
going to send them a nicely packaged
email maybe I'll like spend a few extra
minutes designing it so the customer
feels like they're getting a high
quality product they can see feel and
touch so even if your system doesn't
need deliverables in order to work I
recommend that you modify your system to
include them um and then you know
ideally you just find systems that
produce deliverables as a a consequence
of their operation
so that's very important the second
thing I want to talk about is it needs
to solve some sort of hot button pain
point that a business is experiencing um
if it's not you're typically not going
to be able to charge anywhere near as
much money and uh yeah you'll just
typically have like a worse go of it
during the sales process you're going to
kind of be fighting an uphill battle so
don't fight an uphill battle fight a
downhill battle they're way easier I'm
just look at Obi-Wan so simply put
businesses pay more for solutions to
pressing problems what is a pressing
problem uh anything that impacts your
ability to generate Revenue save money
or free founder time these are the three
big ones you know if a business is
struggling with generating revenue and
they have like a specific need that you
could solve to help them with that they
will pay you a lot of money to have that
solved same thing with bleeding money or
same thing with the founder running all
over the place feeling extraordinarily
stressed and and and like their life's
uh like their life is chaos all the time
obviously the more urgent this need the
easier the sale so the systems that make
the most uh sense to sell are ones that
deal with urgent
needs so some examples this might be
let's say you run uh like a B2B agency
or something and you have a team of
fulfillment staff and they are currently
just waiting around kicking rocks
because they're I don't know there's no
design work for them to do um that means
every single month this business is
bleeding a few thousand per person
paying them to just sit and wait around
this is a very urgent need not only are
they losing money there they're also
losing money in opportunity costs since
they're not making any new sales to
begin with so you know if you could
solve
this and at least fill the pipeline you
can think of it as uh the the business
let's say this I don't know two
fulfillment staff and you're paying them
$3,000 each if you can at least fill the
pipeline so that they break even on that
you're saving a business $6,000 how much
money is a business willing to pay you
to save them $6,000 probably between
like three I don't know $2 to $3,000
realistically uh another example might
be you're running some B2B SAS product
maybe your support team is overwhelmed
and getting so many inquiries and
there's so few people and because that
response times are lagging and and now
there's major turn what your need is
there is customer support you need
systems that enable customer support or
you need the ability to hire uh you know
customer support staff if you could
solve this and if you could reduce their
turn by like 5% or whatever then
mathematically you will have increased
the lifetime revenue of that um mrr by I
think 5% right like mathematically so
they're making a million dollars a month
or something you've just given them
$50,000 I think unless I don't know I'm
being dumb but you're making a lot of
money for them so they're willing to pay
you a fraction of that to solve it
another might be that you I don't know
you're running some some other business
maybe you are a copywriter and you're
invoicing your clients and your invoice
processing blows and that means well you
send a lot of invoices and you get a lot
of work maybe like 20% of them um just
don't pay you right or they don't pay
you on time if that is the case your
need is a better invoice process and if
you solve that then you can basically
take the portion of the amount of money
that is in accounts receivable or
outstanding basically and then you could
like charge a fraction of it to solve
that problem so yeah I'm just trying to
harp on you guys that you know the real
problems that you solve that make money
in this industry like when you solve
them you can charge a fraction or
percentage of that price um this is
called value based pricing it's
something that I and many high earning
automation companies do because every
time that you know a problem is not
solved it costs a business some
theoretical sum when you build a system
that solves that theoretical sum you're
basically putting a bunch of money back
in their pocket which is freaking
amazing okay need number three or rather
Point number three is that you need to
be able to build this using templates
whatever your system is you should be
able to copy and paste 80% % of it then
maybe make some minor tweaks the reason
why is because this minimizes your work
while also letting you generate a
tangible return on client investment
ASAP and then you're also um basically
minimizing buyer remorse which is a
really big one like when a customer pays
you something especially for a
consulting or a technical service that
they can't really conceptualize the
value of when your customer pays you
something and then they don't get
something in return for like a month
that entire month they sort of have this
little buyers remorse thing where
they're like well I'm out a bunch of
money for the service but I haven't
actually got that like the value that
I've been paying for it just yet um and
the longer that goes on typically the
harder it is to to upsell clients to get
them on long-term retainers uh basically
your goal as an agency any any sort of
agency or freelancer really any service
business just to minimize buyer Remorse
by generating a tangible return on their
investment and you do that using
templates if you get a new client you
can build a system for them in three
days or something that solves a need
starts actually delivering an Roi that
situation um you those sorts of
situations I should say are the ones
that get you long-term client retainers
and that you know get the clients um to
be absolutely Overjoyed working with you
so the cool part about systems is by
nature they are templat right we're
dealing with immaterial software
products code stuff like that you can
literally just copy and paste it and
then voila you're done 90% of the time
that means that all you ever need to do
really is just build a system once and
then you just get to like reap the
Returns on that uh for however long
you're selling that product um the
theoretical ideal system just while I'm
on that is a system that is entirely
deliverable through a or completely
automatically I want you to think about
this uh if you know you are delivering
some sort of website building service
hypothetically and then you know you
sign the deal when you sign the deal you
trigger a form to be sent to the client
that asks all the questions and then
when they fill it out they instantly get
their website like the the the
scalability of this sort of business is
theoretically infinite all you need to
do is just get as many people in the
front door as humanly possible the back
end takes care of itself I mean
obviously you're probably going to have
some revisions or something but I think
you guys are seeing the point that I'm
making um so it's difficult to attain in
practice I've personally never done this
I've gotten reasonably close but usually
just with lower ticket stuff um but uh
yeah you know that's just something to
something to shoot for here's some
examples again uh the first might be a
CRM template you can duplicate in the
client environment on your platform of
choice that might be I don't know notion
a sauna clickup whatever um the second
might be a series of blueprints the
import of the client make.com or NAD
environment that you only ever have to
make minor tweaks to afterwards maybe
you are trolling through upwork looking
for uh systems so what you do is you
don't just type systems or automations
you actually typee like email systems or
email automations and then you have like
four or five uh templates or blueprints
for these systems that like kind of
closely match what the customer is
looking to they're not n they're not all
the way there but they're like 90% of
the way there well you could just say
hey you know like I'm I'm going to build
you out the system and then instead of
you having to build it from scratch now
you you at least get 90% of the way
there with the template you basically
get to leverage and and and Arbitrage
your time uh you know instead of you
doing uh all of the work from 0% to 100%
% you do the work from 90% to 100% but
you get to charge as if you were going
from 0% to
100% the last example here might be a
creative brief your client fills out
which triggers a flow that generates a
Business website sort of like my API
example okay I think we're done with
that dry stuff let's actually show you
what these systems are because I know
that's what everybody here's waiting for
I want you to know that you can build
these systems exactly as they are
written down or you can produce
variations of them they fulfill the
requirements above or they're built in
such a way that you can modify them to
do so like you can swap clickup to
notion if you're using notion instead of
click up or whatever um I also have
talked about and blueprints for all
these systems scattered through my
YouTube channel uh except for one I
believe um and I'm going to be recording
a video of me building that um
momentarily and you can also find These
Blueprints and these templates uh on my
gum Road and there are also many that
have been built more than once on
different platforms so you know if
you're working on zapier or something
and the system is nadn that's okay you
can absolutely just like build the
system on zapier um you know look at the
blueprint stare at it um and grock it
and then just look for like equivalent
modules at the end of the day all no
code platforms these days are basically
the same anyway all right so the very
first system I'm going to show you guys
is a deep personalization system that is
built in n8n as I mentioned you can
apply this to any no code platform that
you want I'll show you how to do that in
a second but um from a bird's eye view
what the system is is it's a it's a
series of prompts that allows you to
customize the hell out of outbound
Outreach completely automatically we are
going to scrape the data from a web
service that allows us to pull email
addresses from publicly available
profiles we're then going to Loop over
it get LinkedIn profile data from that
feed that into Ai and then add it to a
spreadsheet which we can then tie into
some cold email platform like instantly
now the reason why this is so valuable
is because it's not your run-of- the-
maill personalization it's not just like
you're doing the the first line of an
email like most people do what we're
doing is we're personalizing every
aspect of the email that is going out
and we're doing it at scale and on mass
um so much so that the person that will
receive this email is going to think
holy crap this guy really did his
research this is going to make it seem
almost as if this is not a cold Outreach
anymore but but like it's warm Outreach
because you know everything about the
person you know their whole career
history you're asking insightful
questions you'd only know if you'd
actually like read them and so on and so
forth so what you're basically doing
with this system is you're producing an
AI engine that reaches out to a near
infinite number of people per day and
you're only upper bound on how many
people you want to reach out to um is
going to be the email inboxes the number
that you have using your cold email
platform and then the um amount of money
that you're spending on Ops here are the
things that it solves first of all it
solves money it solves reply rate solves
leads these are usually the biggest
bottlenecks in any business and they're
the hardest ones to fulfill as well so
right off the bat this is
extraordinarily valuable the second is
it produces a clear deliverable these
are customized leads in a spreadsheet
some sort of cold email platform it's a
CRM it's all three and then as a
byproduct delivers replies you actually
get replies in your inbox right and you
get more replies than you do with
basically any other sort of cold email
enrichment system uh because you're
doing deep personalization but you're
doing it well and I'm going to show you
how with some some Nifty prompts that
I've set up here you can also create
templates to make your work easy um you
know you can just copy this into the
client na environment if you wanted to
or you could just run all this on your
own account you can build this in all
major no code platforms and you can sell
this from anywhere from $1,500 to 5,000
USD fixed price that's with no add-ons
you can also charge an hourly rate to
implement this although I wouldn't
recommend that um as well as some sort
of monthly maintenance fee and many
people in my communities which are now
over uh almost 1,400 people as of the
time of this this video I have sold
systems like this for for substantially
more than 5,000 USD a pop not to mention
if you take into account things like
Revenue share equity share that sort of
stuff um you know this number a lot of
the time can can double or even triple
so let me actually run he guys through
what the system looks like um as I
mentioned built this out in n8n uh I
know that most of my viewers are
probably more familiar with make at this
point just because the bulk of my videos
have been on that on no code or
automation platform so just to give
everybody some context um this is a web
hook which is basically synonymous
across all platforms you are getting an
event from some service the event that
we are getting in this case is going to
be appify appify um for those of you
that are unfamiliar is a Marketplace
that allows you to scrape things
essentially and all you really need to
do most of the time is just enter in
like the URL of the thing you want to
scrape and you're good to go so turns
out there's this one um scraper called
the Apollo scraper which allows you to
scrape a um basically a big lead
aggregator service called Apollo and
then from that you can extract up to
50,000 leads per search for a price of
just a120 per thousand leads most of
these are going to have email addresses
and here's an example of the data that
you would get pretty sweet right so all
you need to do is you just go into
Apollo and you you make a search you say
I'm looking for CEOs in California or
something and then it will actually go
and it'll try and pull you every CEO in
California as well as their email
addresses their LinkedIn URLs uh it's
kind of magical if you think about it
that way from there what we're doing is
we're doing another call to apiz a API
which I'll show you guys uh when when we
actually run this thing from start to
finish and that just retrieves the
actual items that we just scraped then
We're looping over each of these items
and in nadn when you Loop over and this
is just sort of like saying uh you know
for the first entry I'm going to do all
this stuff then I'm going to Loop over
and do the same thing for the second
entry then I'm going to Loop over and do
the same thing for the third entry the
reason why we have that is just because
some API limitations some of the apis
that we're using some of the services
that we're using I should say they have
like right limits and so we just want to
space it out after that we have an if um
and we're basically saying hey if we got
the email address then we can proceeded
what we do next is we use another
service called
lead. lead magic is a pretty nifty
service that essentially allows you to
feed in a LinkedIn URL uh via API once
you feed in a LinkedIn URL what you get
as a result is you get the entire
LinkedIn profile in all the fields or
all the fields that matter I should say
um so I just fed in my own which was
linkedin.com
Nicholas that handsome bass right over
there um who that uh and then as a
result got headlines um I got like an
about section I obviously got a ton of
information about you know like uh uh
where I work and so on and so forth and
the idea is what we do with that is we
feed that into Ai and we basically have
ai personalize um a bunch of Outreach
for us and before we add to a Google
sheet and in terms of what the data
actually looks like at the end of it I
have a bunch of data that I scraped here
just 10 records um for just a bunch of
people in I don't know I guess Aerospace
or mechanical engineering if we scroll
over to the right this this is basically
what we get as a result we get subject
lines we get ice breakers we get
elevator pitches we get call to actions
and then finally we even get a little PS
field and I'll show you what all that
looks like in our actual qu Emil
platform so this is pretty sweet um this
is sweet uh not necessarily just because
it's you know built in NN or I don't
know we're doing the personalization but
kind of like we're we're chaining
together three or four of these
different services that independently
don't really do anything but when you
combine them all you can essentially
completely automate something that's a
pretty laborious part of most people's
work now the end result from this so
what we get is we get a lead inside of
well we don't get a lead inside of but I
made this General enough that you could
just import the leads into whatever your
platform is um but I'll show you you can
get a lead inside of a cold email
platform like instantly that allows you
to then scale up the number of emails
that you send and the way that it works
as we fill variables like Icebreaker
elevator pitch call to action same ones
you saw a second ago and then PS as well
as subject line um and then in that way
basically all of our emails seem
extraordinarily unique but they still
follow a structure right of the main
issues with AI being used in cold
Outreach I found is just that it
typically doesn't follow structure and
kind of fall apart okay great and the
last thing I want to do just before we
wrap up here is I want to show you what
this flow actually looks like um in n8n
we have to just limit the number of
items that are coming out the other side
unfortunately otherwise it uh just gets
a little bit weird and can be a little
bit much so let me just do that really
quickly uh and basically what I'm going
to do is the way that this flow works is
it it looks to see if there's an email
address but because not every record is
going to have an email address I'm just
con going to connect this little false
output to the um uh next module as well
normally this would stop if there were
no um email addresses this time it's
going to proceed just so we could see
what all the logic looks like but if you
were to run this for yourself just make
sure to take that out okay now let's
head back over to appify Let's click
Start and let's scrape this
puppy uh as I mentioned this is going to
be scraping this Apollo resource but I
mean apify is amazing uh it sort of
understands in their applications allow
you to scrape anything that you freaking
want I've used it to scrape Instagram
before Tik Tok Twitter uh Reddit right
use it to make like an automatic
newsletter generator which I'll show you
guys in a moment um it is a very very
powerful platform and if you configure
it right you can do basically whatever
the hell you want with it which is quite
nice okay great so it just found our uh
flow it's now requesting the LinkedIn
profile doing the five column
personalization let me just show you
guys what this actually looks like in
practice I'm it's just going to add that
to our Google
sheet let me just make sure that this is
oh sorry if we go back here we see that
we've added uh person and uh what else
we did was we went and we customized the
hell out of the
Outreach pretty
neat damn that is pretty
neat and then looks like we've just done
that for the second lead as
well and then uh yeah you know this
basically just goes on and I believe I I
set a wait of I don't know how long is
my waight that's like 5 seconds or so so
you can set the weight at whatever you
want I just did 5 Seconds cuz I didn't
want this API to get overwhelmed um
sometimes the Google Sheets API for me
anyway um kind of uh times out or rather
not times out but but gets rate limited
so the benefit there is you know once
you have the spreadsheet um all you need
to do is you just you know go over here
you download it um as a CS Fe and then
you head over to instantly which in my
case is the service that I'm going to be
uploading the emails to um and then you
click uh leads you click add leads then
you can just drag and drop this in it's
the same thing for smart lead and for
anything else the end result is you're
going to essentially get an email that
includes all of these columns right so
if I could just show you guys an example
on one of
them you know this email let me just add
to step this is basically something like
the email that you are going to be
sending um so this is pretty hyper
customized right uh you know one of the
things about this company that they keep
on mentioning all the time is their
focus on Innovation and this and that
and that you basically get to slap that
in there you got a little PS here which
also makes it seem um kind of human
written uh the subject line is
customized you know if you were to send
this to some uh and have multiple levels
of personalization the likelihood of an
open and of ultimately them doing
something with it is a lot higher so I'm
just going to turn this off because um
it's just going through and and
continuing to chug and consume Ops in
the background then I'm going to
download
this then we're going to head back over
to the next system okay the second
system I want to talk about is a search
intent lead scraper um this is something
that I did a video on just a few weeks
ago and it's similarly involved in cold
email you're going to see a lot of
things um that I build that I sell and
make good money with to revolve around
some sort of Outreach just because this
is typically the most scalable way to
employer apply Automation Services in
such a way that you can make money with
them but essentially what this is is
this is a way to scrape leads but not
just scrape leads generally using the
same approach we did earlier but to
scrape them with specific intent so the
reason why it's called search intent is
because what we're doing is we're
actually scraping job listings instead
of people we get these job listings for
companies that have listed hey I want to
hire a sales associate or a business
development representative or an
accounting executive and the reason why
we're we're scraping that is because we
know that if a company has put up a job
post for account executive or sales
representative or something like the
need that they have is they need more
leads and they need more more sales and
they're willing to literally spend money
to solve that problem so the second that
you search for leads with intent like
that you can typically multiply not only
the average ticket price of the service
that you're selling but also just make
the entire interaction a lot easier so
yeah this solves money reply rate
unqualified leads no leads in the queue
uh disorganized sales process unutilized
sales team and ultimately chaos it also
produces a clear deliverable in the form
of um you know an email address which is
pretty sweet and then a series of fields
in a Google sheet or some sort of cold
email platform um as I mentioned you can
create blueprints on all major no code
platforms this one's going to be
make.com but yeah you know you could
template out the Google Sheets template
whatever you want and in terms of the
price it's very similar to the previous
system in so far that we're selling
between 1,500 to 5,000 USD although I
should note that you know if you are
selling this as a super high ticket
service if you're selling this to like
B2B um tech companies or uh like um one
of my community members did this with I
think it was a manufacturing company or
something it sold for over
$600,000 um not this system for $600,000
they use this system to sell one of
their clients um a total ticket size of
$600,000 you can you can sell this for
substantially more especially for those
big industrial applications so let me
run you through what the system actually
looks like um this is built out in
make.com instead of NN and it again uses
appify to get scraping results then get
data set items so very similar what we
saw before in NN we then search through
a Google sheet we then add a row if the
job is new and then we also filter the
job before searching for a decision
maker using a platform called any mail
finder um after this we then retrieve
the the enrichment results from any mail
finder research the decision maker using
perplexity which is quite neat generate
an ice breaker which is similar to what
I was showing you guys before just a
little more shallow this time then
automatically add it to our database and
then instantly um so that sounds pretty
well and good but what exactly does any
of this stuff mean um well let me show
you guys what uh yeah let me show you
guys what like an actual um uh result of
this would look like first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to my
Google sheet here okay and what we have
as a result is as you guys could see we
have an ID we then have a tracking ID a
reference ID we have the link to the
specific job post and this is from quite
a while ago so I don't know if this is
actually still be valid okay yeah looks
like they're still hiring this company
tremendous is hiring an SDR sales
development representative which is
pretty sweet um you know the title the
company name name company LinkedIn
company logo we're getting a ton of
fields here um the thing that matters to
us is this description what we do is we
take this description here and we feed
it into Ai and say hey is this something
that we could sell a system to
realistically you give it a list of
systems you say hey we sell X Y and Z is
this a job that we could realistically
apply to if the answer to that is yes
what we do and as you can see this a
pretty big database I got to scroll all
the freaking way down to the
right we get their email address and
then from there we also write um you
know an entire uh pitch basically um
that says hey you know I dig your
mission um it's really cool to see the
transition from blueto to NFC within
blue bite which is the name of their
their business and stuff which is pretty
cool right now let me let me show you
what this actually looks like when you
add this um what we do after that is we
retrieve the result and I'm just going
to run this once to show
you and I believe we need oh my bad I'm
actually out of credits which is why
this isn't uh working wonder if I just
ran this whole thing how many of these
I'd realistically get uh let me just
turn this on and see what happens screw
it this is now going to open up a ton
just run like a million simultaneously
and I was just looking for one that
actually made sense um you can see that
we actually got a CEO of a company um
and then after getting the co of the
company we research this person using
perplexity which is pretty sweet the end
result of this is we got some content
about this person hey you know this
person's the CEO and co-founder of this
here's some key points about him then we
got a ton of information about this
particular person which is amazing as
I'm sure you can imagine you can combine
this with the Icebreaker thing we did
earlier then we generate an ice breaker
here um then we add it to our database
uh which was right over here right or
actually you know we might have a I
might have a different database actually
for this specific one but anyway we add
it to um our database afterwards which
is pretty sweet then uh we also send it
over to instantly which is cool
instantly being our cold email platform
so yeah lot of uh move and steps here
but just for the sake of time I'm not
going to go through every module like I
did with the previous flow just because
I think most people are familiar with
how make.com works at least on my
channel um suffice to say this blueprint
will be down below in the description
and the really cool part about systems
like this is uh one of the reasons why
I've sort of Niche down and I provide a
lot of growth systems like C email is
because the second you start selling one
well one sort of naturally leads into
the other so hypothetically you know
what what if you sell this to somebody
for 4,000 bucks or something and then
after you sell them a deep
personalization system on top that that
takes the data that we generated here
takes some additional data that we're
generating from maybe like lead magic
that API that requests LinkedIn profiles
then we stick it together well now we're
upselling them now we're selling them
two Services as opposed to just one the
third system I'm going to show you guys
is a YouTube parasite plus content
Improvement system as you guys can see
this is a pretty long system I detailed
it in one of my earlier YouTube videos
but in a nutshell what this does is this
scrapes YouTube videos it gets the
transcripts of those YouTube videos then
it uses AI to find gaps in that content
to to make it better the AI then writes
content for you using the tips that
we've provided as well as the source
document then it lets you repurpose that
content for social media YouTube scripts
and more we basically do a bunch of uh
content types like Facebook and and
Twitter and so on and so forth and
automatically can even post them so this
is a pretty sweet system to sell um
because you know a lot of uh well I want
to say that this it depends on the sort
of business that you s this to but SAS
companies tend to like this sort of
stuff because uh they typically have
like well to find competitors whose
YouTube channels they could scrape um
and you know like they could take video
ideas and then repurpose them uh you
know Brands tend to like the stuff like
like influencers and stuff because they
tend to have like five or 10 people in
their Niche that are doing similar
things to them you can think about me
and and you know my my competition on
YouTube for instance we could parasite
them immediately the second that they're
done recording a video and posting it I
could immediately flip that around and
then start creating some sort of new
better content that solves the needs of
the market even cooler than they did um
but anyway the point that I'm making is
uh this produces a clear deliverable
social media post content scripts it
solves some hot button needs it's
templat and you can actually sell this
anywhere from 1,500 to 5,000 USD fixed
price um I know a lot of people have
sold for for less than this amongst my
groups um but I think that you know if
you go anywhere less than like $1,500
system like this you're definitely
underpricing yourself uh and you can Al
obviously make tweaks to the system now
in terms of how the system works um it
starts by triggering an appify actor to
run and it's going and and pulling a
specific appify actor that I think we've
um not looked at precisely ourselves
YouTube vide subtitles or caption
scraper basically what we're doing is we
have a sheet full of YouTube videos to
scrape okay and you can populate this
very easily using another appify actor
if you want like there are a variety of
systems out there that dump YouTube
videos that you scrape into this but I'm
just assuming you already have one
because I didn't want this to be like 17
scenarios long um but basically once
once you you get a YouTube video The you
every YouTube video has some video ID
over here and what you do is you take
that video
ID you search the row so you get it and
then you feed it into this app IFI run
and actor module this is where you paste
the URL or the ID I got yeah I guess the
URL in this case not the ID of the video
that you want to scrape this then runs a
caption scraper so then we watch the
actor runs we will get the data set
items we're going to do a bunch of
processing um to basically get the
transcript into a reasonable format for
us um so what I'm doing here is I'm
calling GPT 40 with um a prompt that
basically says something along the lines
of hey we're in content based on YouTube
transcripts what I want you to do is I
want you to summarize it write an
outline with it write some suggestions
about it and then output it in this Json
format here uh and then from there we're
actually taking the suggestions and
using them to upgrade the outline that
we generated from a previous step and
this is kind of neat um most people will
try and apply it to the actual content
itself but if you do this to an outline
rather than the actual content itself
like if you feed in an um an outline and
say hey this is an outline of content I
want you to make this outline better
then when you take that outline and then
feed it back into AI to have it rewrite
the whole thing
uh you know you end up a lot more
flexible and there's a lot less like
plagiarism stuff involved you're not
just like changing the wording here or
there you're actually like doing it with
an outline so yeah there a bunch of
rules there you guys feel free to check
it out in the um in the template and
then from here we generate social media
posts the social media posts we start
with are um just the Classic ones so I
think there's Facebook brain okay so
Twitter post Instagram Facebook yeah and
then LinkedIn um so we generate these
four social media posts using AI after
that we then generate a YouTube script
using AI as well so this is a script for
a complimentary video that uses as input
that outline we then smooth out the
script and then we generate an Instagram
post a Twitter post Facebook post
LinkedIn post YouTube script even then
we update our rows which is pretty cool
so yeah this is you know obviously
pretty involved if I go over here to uh
sorry let's go back over here if I go
over here to the right hand side you see
we have the Instagram
post we have the Twitter post oh we even
have the YouTube script so at the end of
it you know you get a bunch of um
content and data now um you know is this
stuff that I think would perform really
well on on Facebook or Instagram as as
is right now no I don't think this would
perform really really well um and the
reason why is because I typically always
recommend that my clients have like a
two- pass system where they basically
have a human in the loop which make now
has a feature for by the way where after
it's done creating something you add it
to your queue and then you say something
along the lines of hey you know this is
ready for QA human comes in you know it
changes the wording a little bit here or
there to try and make it a little bit
closer what it is that your um brand
tone of voice is and the reason why I do
that is because in practice like while
you know it can be quite impressive um I
think to generate this much content all
at once uh usually it does not
understand brand tone of voice or Style
Guidelines anywhere near as well as a
human being would U but anyway yeah and
here we have like a big long YouTube
script so you can see 10 whole pages
feel free to check all that stuff out um
that is system number three system
number four is an automated newsletter
production system which is quite similar
in nature I want to say instead of us
using appify to find uh you know YouTube
uh scripts or sorry uh YouTube videos
and then converting those into you know
captions and extracting the captions and
doing fun stuff with that what we're
doing instead is we're actually scraping
Reddit so the system takes data from
Reddit specific subreddits that you
specify uses AI to process them and
filter them then if it's within the
realm of what we'd consider to be a
highquality newsletter item um it
processes them summarizes them and then
adds them to a nicely formatted
newsletter in MailChimp from here you
basically have a completely automated
newsletter production system you can run
as often as you want you can run this
puppy once a day you can run this puppy
hell once an hour run this puppy once a
year U whatever sort of you know clip
you want to run a system like this on um
you are free to so I'm just going to
jump over here and show you guys what
this looks like we'll go to Reddit post
database in terms of the um structure of
the database as you guys can see I just
use Google Sheets for everything it's
the simplest database out there what you
do is you feed in a few few subreddits
so we fed in uh some uh communities
called Singularity artificial
intelligence open AI um I think there
was one more artificial intelligence
like with one L or something doesn't
look like we got any post from them
though um and then appify will go and
it'll it'll scrape a bunch of these give
us a bunch of posts right which looks
pretty
cool what we do is we take these posts
and then we use them to generate
something here so we have a second
database this database then creates
basically um a whole pitch so um I
pretended my newsletter like my
newsletter was called The Loop welcome
to Loop Cutting Edge AA news explain in
simple English in this week's issue
spicy thing one spicy thing two spicy
thing three and then we actually go
through and we we use the filtering
logic that I've set up before to show
you in a second to write this whole
thing which is pretty neat um this is
probably one of the higher value flows I
would say um I'd sell this from anywhere
between 1,500 to $10,000 fixed price I
should note that I haven't actually sold
this specific system for $10,000 fixed
price I just put system together myself
live on camera a few weeks ago so I have
yet to but um I'm confident that a
system like this could probably get even
more for the right business just because
the end result is like very curatable
content and you could use this sort of
thing for anything you don't just need
to use it for a newsletter you could use
this to like make YouTube short scripts
or something um very modifiable um and
you know it's sort of like the the
Nugget for a variety of systems in terms
of what it looks like if you just lay it
out um we do watch actor runs we get the
data set items same thing as before we
then filter posts using AI this is kind
of kind of like the Crux of this if you
screw this part up the rest of it
doesn't really work uh so what we start
with is Q Jeopardy music we're designing
a newsletter that contains news and
exciting in uh developments in AI your
task is to filter out irrelevant Reddit
posts so they don't make it to our
newsletter here are a bunch of rules and
then return relevance in Json using this
format true or false what we do is we
then add this to the first datab base
assuming that it is relevant and then we
have a second half to this flow what the
second half this flow does is however
often we want to schedule our newsletter
which in my case was Monday at 6 we then
go through grab all of the posts and
it's not just all the posts but it's all
the posts that have our filter of post
status equal new and this is kind of
like an interesting hack that allows you
to only pull from um posts that are
posts that we have not actually created
a newsetter for so as you can see all
these are published on the right hand
side these ones are all new so any ones
that are new we um we then add to that
Quee and then we proceed through ically
generating headlines and Snippets
generating introductions and titles then
we even go as far as adding them to
MailChimp and then sending the
newsletter to all of the subscribers of
that in mail champ so pretty neat stuff
um as I mentioned I haven't actually
sold that specific system for anywhere
near $10,000 but I'm confident that you
could sell systems like this very easily
for that amount of money just given um
how similar it is to these other systems
that have proven success behind them so
the first person in my community is to
sell this particular system send me over
a DM and maybe I'll make a video about
it okay great last one is a copy and
paste automatic hiring system which I
think is pretty badass um I've been
using this and selling this for well
over two years now or just coming up on
two years now and essentially what this
is is it's a hiring system that
eliminates the need for any sort of back
and forth with candidates what we're
doing is we're turning hiring from like
this very uh I don't know like
one-on-one timec consuming thing into an
automated process that uses a form that
they fill out to request the job that
then lets you automatically accept or
decline then if you accept proceeds
forward with a trial request then if
they do a good job on the trial then you
can you know extend them an an an
interview or an onboarding opportunity
so this solves a bunch of hot button
pain points hiring takes forever our
margins suck we don't have enough staff
everything's always disorganized hiring
is cost efficient chaos um as you can
see it's also very pretty which produces
a clear deliverable we got nice colors
we got names we got portfolios links
it's in a
CRM um you know you can template It Out
by simply cop and pasting a service like
this which is super straightforward and
easy um in in clickup by the way which
is the service that I used to put this
together then you can also sell it from
anywhere between 2K all the way up to
10K um that's no add-ons uh if you
wanted to like do some add-ons to this I
don't know use AI to like run the first
pass of the CV filters you totally could
um you could also charge them an hourly
rate to implement it or make tweaks and
then a maintenance or management fee on
the hiring system um this sort of stuff
crushes with recruitment businesses
because recruitment businesses despite
having like their whole business be
essentially this process um just for
whatever reason cannot systematize it I
don't know so yeah in terms of what the
specific system looks like this is the
CRM template that I've put together here
as you see I've added some documentation
called how this pipeline works so I even
go through and this is for my own
business I actually use this in my
business but just to give you the tldr
um we have a General application form
that somebody fills out when they fill
it out they're add another new applicant
to show you guys what this form looks
like if I go to type form over here this
is basically it a nutshell what role are
you applying for who am I because this
is to work with my business I have
definitely do not have that many
subscribers oh I must have added an
extra zero that's funny I guess I'm at
40,000
now thank you very much um contact
details please enter your name and email
address below portfolio we ask for
portfolio location of the person start
date as soon as they'd be able to begin
weekly availability and this is kind of
a Nifty thing that uh like I do and and
have done with all of my agencies
because my business partner at the time
brought it up and I thought it was
brilliant but I basically see nobody
else do it it's where you ask the
applicant for the hourly rate that they
want when you ask an applicant for the
hourly rate that they want they
basically I mean you think of this as a
little bit evil but they basically start
competing against themselves and they uh
usually you know what we do is we'll
we'll say in the job post like on indeed
or something um average hourly rate $25
they see this and they'll bid 23 you're
thinking okay well 23 versus 25 that's
not that much but it's like that
actually is it's 8% you you immediately
added 8% to your uh cost of goods sorry
you've reduced 8% to the employment part
of your your cost of goods or services
which is crazy um and then you know if
there's somebody that is extraordinarily
talented they pitch a lot of money and
when they pitch a lot of money you know
that shows you that shows yourself that
they're very confident that they believe
they're very good at what they do which
is also a positive so anyway the way
this hiring system works is you will
fill out this form after you're done
filling out this form they're added
under the new applicant field for the
role that they applied to so Peter Smith
Steve and Nix for instance I mean
obviously these are fake names but um
yeah they're added under here with all
of that data then what happens
afterwards is you have the ability to
confirm and then request a trial if you
move them over to request a trial what
happens is they're automatically sent a
um templated email with a task that they
should finish now if they're a video
editor for instance which is what I was
hiring for here let me show you guys
what that form looks
like track your time using clockify or
another time tracking app your task is
to create a short form 15 to 30 second
clip here's a
brief quite in-depth brief here's a
Google Drive link to upload the thing to
and then the way that our company does
it is we pay people for trials we're not
so that's why we ask them to
track their time send me an invoice when
I send them an invoice I pay them within
48 business hours by card wise um or or
whatever so yeah great system um this is
pieced together with not only uh the the
CRM here which I will provide available
to you guys um as a clickup link you
guys feel free to Just Produce the exact
same one by the way um in a Google sheet
or notion or whatever you want so you
can see the columns here aren't
necessarily rocket science but uh it's
cool not necessarily just because it's
you know a clickup thing um it's just
cool because it's like a basically
Universal approach to hiring that I
think extends Beyond just
systems all right that's that for
uh five more systems that you could sell
today to make between $1,500 to $110,000
I hope you guys appreciated this if you
guys have any questions about any of the
systems that I put together just let me
know drop them down below um I've done
videos on the majority of them up until
this point I think I'm probably going to
have to re-record the video on the
hiring system because I uh created it I
think when I was at like 500 subs or a
th000 subs or something and probably
didn't have a lot of reach so not a lot
of people understand the functional
utility of something like this I'm going
to be building out the nadn tutorial for
that deep personalization system as well
I'm going to be doing that live just to
show you guys my thoughts as I put it
together so aside from that everything
else you can find on my YouTube channel
uh and I'll make sure to include all the
resources and everything else you need
below really appreciate it if you have
any suggestions for future videos or
content I Source most of my ideas from
my audience at this point thank you very
much to everybody that has done so so
far and I'll catch you on the next video
